Description: The general workflow of most imputation methods is quite similar.
    The aim of this package is to implement some of this general workflow.
    The heart of an imputation method is normally the used model. These models
    can be defined using the `parsnip` package or customised specifications.
    The "rest" of an imputation method are more technical specification e.g. 
    which columns and rows should be used for imputation and in which order.
